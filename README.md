## üéØ Overview

A sophisticated Natural Language Processing (NLP) application that accurately detects and classifies emotions from text input. Leveraging machine learning algorithms, this tool identifies six core emotional states: **joy**, **sadness**, **anger**, **fear**, **surprise**, and **love**.

## ‚ú® Features

- **Real-time Emotion Classification**: Instant analysis of text input
- **High Accuracy**: 97.4% model accuracy on test data
- **Multi-format Input**: Support for direct text input and file upload
- **Confidence Metrics**: Detailed probability scores for each emotion
- **Interactive Web Interface**: Built with Streamlit for seamless user experience
- **RESTful Architecture**: Ready for API integration

## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.9+
- pip package manager
- Virtual environment (recommended)

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/AdeenaRamzan/text-emotion-detection-nlp.git
   cd text-emotion-detection-nlp

2. **Create virtual environment**
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   
3. Install dependencies
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   
4. Run the application
   streamlit run app.py


Usage:
- Direct Text Input: Enter text in the provided text area
- Example Texts: Use pre-loaded examples for quick testing
- File Upload: Upload .txt files for batch processing
- Analysis: Click "Analyze Emotion" to get results with confidence scores


üèóÔ∏è Model Architecture

= Vectorization: TF-IDF with custom preprocessing
= Classifier: Ensemble machine learning model
= Feature Engineering: N-grams and semantic analysis
- Training Data: Curated dataset of 25,000+ labeled text samples
